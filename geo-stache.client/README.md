# Geo-Stache

Geco-Stache is designed to be a open-source, user-oriented geocaching companion. Utilizing mobile-first design, we created Geo-Stache to improve the accessibility to and participation in this fun, outoodrs activity!


Our Goals:
- Improve accessibility compared to other geocaching resources by excluding pay-to-play elements
- Set a relaxed, engaging tone that welcomes novice players alongside their more seasoned counterparts
- Utilize open-source engagement to maintain a community-oriented and community-driven focus
