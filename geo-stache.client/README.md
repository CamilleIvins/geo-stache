# Geo-Stache

Geo-Stache, the new open-source geocaching companion.

We created Geo-Stache to improve accessibility and increase participation in geocaching, an activity we all enjoy.

Our Goals:
-Establish the geocaching activity to be accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial situation or experience level.
-Open Source: Geo-Stache is open source, which means it is community-driven.
-Gamified and Communal: We've gamified the geocaching experience, making it more fun and social. Connect with fellow cachers, share your adventures, and discover new places.
